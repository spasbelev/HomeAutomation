# Home Automation

The idea of the project is to do home automation as DIY project.

## Getting Started

Raspberry pi board and the Wiring Pi.

### Prerequisites

Wiring Pi library for the Raspbery pi GPIO

```

```

### Installing



```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Currently there are no unit tests. Unit test will be added and will be made with the help of QT Creater

## Deployment
In order to deploy the code you need Orange Pi Lite board. Currently the software does not support the Raspberry Pi boards and other Orange Pi boards due to pin alignment. In the future the software running on the boards will be configurable.
